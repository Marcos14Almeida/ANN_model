Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","[[0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [1 1]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [1 0]]\n","\n","Confusion Matrix\n","[[43 10]\n"," [11 14]]\n","Accuracy:  0.7307692307692307\n","F1 Score:  0.6875834445927904\n"]}]}]}
