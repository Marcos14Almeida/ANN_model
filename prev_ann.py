# Artificial Neural Network

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
tf.__version__

# Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('data_users.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[0:, 0:7].values
y = dataset.iloc[0:, 7].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)

# Feature Scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
# Part 2 - Building the ANN
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential #Inicializa Neural Network ->sequence of layers
from keras.layers import Dense #create nodes
# Initializing the ANN
ann = tf.keras.models.Sequential()

# Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer
ann.add(Dense(units=12, activation = 'relu', kernel_initializer = 'uniform', input_shape = (7, )))

# Adding the second hidden layer
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
# Adding the second hidden layer
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))


# Adding the output layer
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Part 3 - Training the ANN

# Compiling the ANN
ann.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

# Training the ANN on the Training set
ann.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 1, epochs = 10)

# Part 4 - Making the predictions and evaluating the model

# Predicting the result of a single observation
"""
Therefore, our ANN model predicts that this customer stays in the bank!
Important note 1: Notice that the values of the features were all input in a double pair of square brackets. That's because the "predict" method always expects a 2D array as the format of its inputs. And putting our values into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array.
Important note 2: Notice also that the "France" country was not input as a string in the last column but as "1, 0, 0" in the first three columns. That's because of course the predict method expects the one-hot-encoded values of the state, and as we see in the first row of the matrix of features X, "France" was encoded as "1, 0, 0". And be careful to include these values in the first three columns, because the dummy variables are always created in the first columns.
